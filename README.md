# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Follow up questions

1) How long, in hours, did you spend on the test (not including learning)?
Ans:10 hrs

2) Did you have to learn any new languages/technologies? If so, which ones and what
resources did you use for your learning?
Ans: I am not learning any new languages/technologies for this task.

3) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
Ans:i can implement login screen, add player profile image if i have more time

4) What did you spend the most time on? What did you find most difficult?
Ans: i have spend time on matrial UI config due to dependency issue with npm installation.
so i have used yarn installation. Not faced any difficulties

5) How did you find the test overall? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the
test weâ€™d love to hear them.
Ans: I have tested by manual. my suggestions we can use testing framework like Jest or Mocha
for testing

## Install dependency

### `yarn install`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
